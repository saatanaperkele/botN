Did you know you will go to hell for working on a sunday?
These are tough times, we should put on The Full Armour of God to endure them
God, our lord, king of ages, all-powerful and almighty, you who made everything and who transforms everything. You who in the Babylon changed into dew the flames of the "seven-times hotter" furnace and protected and saved the three holy children. We beeseech you to make powerless the unholy spirits that lurk within %s!
Wherefore  take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand  in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
Stand therefore, having your loins agirt about with btruth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of afaith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
And take the helmet of asalvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
In the name of the holy father I hereby baptize %s!
Abortion is murder!
The time you spend alone with God will transform your character and  increase your devotion. Then your integrity and godly behavior in an  unbelieving world will make others long to know the Lord.
In our friendships we have to be wise that we choose godly people to be our friends. Somebody might say, well does that mean that you should never have a lost person as your friend? No, I wouldn't say that. But you can't have the same intimacy with a lost person that you can with a godly person in whom the Holy Spirit is living.
When the solution is simple, God is answering.
Thank the Lord Almighty for all of thine blessings.

Earthly wisdom is doing what comes naturally. Godly wisdom is doing what the Holy Spirit compels us to do.
So that godly sorrow may be discerned by this train of graces wherewith it is accompanied, that worldly sorrow wants, at least in the truth of them, though it may have some shadows of them.

You shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination (Leviticus 18:22)
So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. He said to her, Get up; les , But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home
Praise the one and only, God, Lord, savior, and holy ghost; Jesus!
